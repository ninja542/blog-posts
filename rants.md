# Rant post

This is a random rant, and I forgot what prompted this rant. Posted with some additions. 

Here's a little rant about how people don't think coding a web app is real coding. I mean, it's javascript, and you're still solving problems. Even though those problems might not be conventional algorithmic problems, they still require creative solutions. Here's a list of nice triumphs: 

- Simplified my code by 50%
- Figured out how to switch between different lenses and drawing techniques. 
- Figuring out accurate collisions between particles

I feel like web app design with javascript is seen as like basic, but it's still important for people to continue designing web apps. Google has done a spectacular job with its webapps, like Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar, webapps are becoming more and more useful and I think it could replace phone apps.

Additionally, you can see the success of Chromebooks, where they can only run web apps, is due to design of great webapps. (However, Google does haave an initiative to bring Android apps to ChromeOS, but the fact that the chromebook is surprisingly more useful than it was thought initially is impressive.)
