# Reflections from my independent study

I have never written a blog post before, and I was going to start a sarcastic blog, but I just wanted to write this down, to remind the future me what it is like to work on a personal project, and not to sit at home all day and do nothing. 

I think I took my independent study for granted, and I didn't realize that not every high school offers this opportunity to design your own class. 

I think that designing a class has made me appreciate what teachers do so much more because planning a class is hard. I mean I did design lesson plans for teaching coding, but somehow designing an entire class is different. My high school tells you that you have to design a schedule and a rubric. I planned my projects down to the day, but I think that it was a little too rigid and sometimes unexpected things would pop up, from TOK meetings to talking to Mr. Gell about interesting physics. I also didn't account for the lack of motivation some days would bring. I also wasted some days with pointless google searches and reading coding articles that weren't really related to my project.

Disabling the internet would help a lot for coding, but right now, I still at the point where I have to google a lot of things while I code. I hope I can get to the point where I don't have to google or look at my past code, because it's kind of embarrassing. 

The freedom is really refreshing. I guess it goes back to Autonomy, which is a form of intrinsic motivation (from the book DRIVE, read it, it's a good book). Every time I work on my project, I am grateful that I have the chance to code something that I think can help others and that I can work together with my Physics teacher, Mr. Gell.

I guess originally, I thought an independent study would help me get into a selective college. It's been a few months since a deferral from MIT, and honestly I don't really care about it. I think I had a long term vision for my independent study that I supplanted with the really short sighted goal of getting into college. (EDIT 5/1: I really regret my short-sightedness back then, but I really enjoy working towards the long term goal, and I hope to continue to do so during college)

If you're looking to propose an independent study/project, make sure that it's something that you actually want to do. Don't make it a "thing" to get into college, because nobody cares. 

Number 2, start coding. A lot of times I felt really aimless and didn't really code for a few days. But then I regret it because then everything becomes rushed near the end of the month, which is the due date that I set for myself. Just start coding, and the flow of the coding will take you. This sounds really cheesy, but I think it's really true.

Number 3. Ask for a lot of feedback. The fountain simulator was a really hard simulation because I didn't really know what is important in a fountain simulator and I asked my teacher for some tips on how to improve it, and it really helped. I wish I asked him earlier. Just because there's something you can improve with your code doesn't mean that you're a failure. You should be proud that you coded up to the point where you can get valuable feedback.

Number 4. Don't be too ambitious. Know your limits. 

Sometimes I try to tackle too much like the fountain simulation with three mini simulations and one game. (EDIT 5/1: I only completed one mini simulation in one month, and I shelved it for later to add particles)

I hope I can expand this blog post into more posts, and I think it'll help to recollect my thoughts and reflect back on my independent study and what I'm learning from it. 

**REMINDER:** don't forget to ask Mr. Gell to show you the senior presentation because it's been two years since you've seen the presentation.

Also I think after making a couple of simulators, I do really need to reflect on how to make good simulations. 

# What makes an effective physics simulation?

I don't really know, but I tried to see if there was any research on the subject. Phet apparently uses studies to make sure that the simulations are effective, but I don't have the resources for that. 

## Engagement

A physics simulator is supposed to be exciting. I think this means good graphics, good animations, and maybe a good game. 

### Animation/Graphics

Since I'm using svgs, my graphics aren't as pretty as Phet graphics, but I think that this simplicity helps with focusing on the core physics concept instead of admiring the graphics or animation. 

The animation pipeline that I have right now is pretty complicated, and I don't know how to use anime.js in the way I want to. The animations from anime.js are very static and don't react to changes in the Vue object. 

## Educational

This would include accurate model of the physical phenomenon and graphs to allow for a intuitive understanding and to interpret graphs.

### Accuracy

Double check the math. 

### Graphs

Make them colorful, labelled, and ways to have different variables represented. 

## Good programming practices

I think that a lot of simulations have potential to be extended or used as parts in other simulations. My simulations aren't component based, and I haven't been very good at documenting code as I should be. 

However, I am proud that I have been able to find different optimizations for different parts of my code.
